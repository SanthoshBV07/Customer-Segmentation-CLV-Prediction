This repository contains my work on **customer segmentation** and **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) prediction** for the next quarter.  

- ðŸ“‚ Dataset: [Ecommerce Data (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data?resource=download)

- ðŸ““ Code: two Jupyter notebooks are provided  
  1. `preprocessing.ipynb` â€“ run this first  
  2. `clust_pred.ipynb` â€“ clustering & prediction  

ðŸ‘‰ To reproduce the results:  
1. Clone or download this repo.  
2. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the project folder.  
3. Run the preprocessing notebook first, then run `clust_pred`.
